# SWDFlasher-STM32 #

This is the first pre-alpha version. It may be unstable and has a number of limitations:
- Error handling is almost absent
- Tested only with small firmware binaries (100 bytes)
- Any bigger binary (especially > 1KB) may cause an error
- The code is kind of dirty and contains many TODOs and not implemented methods
- Some methods should be added/removed/renamed/etc.
